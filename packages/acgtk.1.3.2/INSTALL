*****************
* Prerequisites *
*****************

In order to compile the ACG toolkit, you need:
	+ ocaml (>=3.07) installed (http://caml.inria.fr/)
	+ dypgen (>=20080925) installed (http://dypgen.free.fr/)
	+ bolt (>=1.4) installed (http://bolt.x9c.fr/downloads.html)
        + ANSITerminal (>=0.6.5) installed (https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ansiterminal/)
        + cairo2 (>=0.4.6) installed (http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/cairo/)
	+ easy-format installed (http://mjambon.com/releases/easy-format/easy-format-1.0.2.tar.gz). Required by biniou
	+ biniou (>=1.0.6) installed (http://mjambon.com/biniou.html). Required by yojson
	+ yojson (>=1.1.8) installed (http://mjambon.com/yojson.html). Required by ocf
	+ ocf (>=0.4.0) installed (http://zoggy.github.io/ocf/)

For best results (correct rendering of symbols in the graphical output),
please also install the free DejaVu fonts (http://dejavu-fonts.org).


=======
IMPORTANT:

A fast an easy way to install dypgen and all important ocaml libraries is
to use "opam" (http://opam.ocaml.org/).

The installation typically goes that way:
    + first install OCaml using your prefered distribution/packaging mode
    + then install opam
    + then install the required libraries with the command
      	   opam install dypgen bolt ANSITerminal cairo2
    + don't forget to add the required library in your path
      (look at "Initializing opam" at 
      http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Advanced_Install.html)
    + then continue with the ACG toolkit installation



To install the ACG toolkit, first run:

	./configure

NOTE: if your dypgen installation is not in a standard location, run:

	 ./configure --help

It will tell you:
"Some influential environment variables:
  DYPGEN_PATH Directory where to find dypgen if not in a standard location
  DYPGENLIB_PATH
              Directory where to find dypgen library if not in a standard
              location

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations."

For instance, run:
	
	./configure DYPGEN_PATH=/my/dypgen/installation/path/dypgen DYPGENLIB_PATH=/my/dypgen/installation/path/dyplib

Then run:

	make byte

to get the bytecode executable, or

	make opt

to get native code binaries

It should produce two executables in the current directory: acgc (or
acgc.opt for the native code executable) and acg (or acg.opt for the
native code executable).

If you wan to install it (use ./configure --help to set the
installation directory if you don't want to have it in
/usr/local/bin), run:

	make install

If you wan to uninstall it then run:

	make uninstall


If you want to install the emacs mode and the examples (see below for
the installation details), you can run

        make install-emacs
and
	make install-examples

respectively.

To uninstall them, run:

        make uninstall-emacs
and
	make uninstall-examples

respectively.


Those 3 steps are covered by the command

        make install-all
and
	make uninstall-all




********************
** ACG emacs mode **
********************

There is an ACG emacs mode (acg.el) in the emacs directory.

** Quick way to have it work:

copy the following lines in your .emacs

(setq load-path (cons "EMACS_DIR_PATH" load-path))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.acg" . acg-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'acg-mode "acg" "Major mode for editing ACG definitions" t)

** if you run 

      make install-emacs

the emacs directory and the emacs/acg.el file will be copied in the
/DATAROOTDIR/acgtk directory. The default value for /DATAROOTDIR is
/PREFIX/share except if you ran the ./configure script with some
--datarootdir=/SOME/DIR option.

If you installed acgtk using opam, then the default path is

	OPAM_REPOSITORY/OCAML_VERSION/share/acgtk

To uninstall the emacs mode, run:

      make uninstall-emacs

** Site distribution:
   
copy acg.el under an acg directory in your site-lisp directory
(typically /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/)

create a 50acg.el file into the /etc/emacs/site-start.d directory and
copy the following lines in it:

(setq load-path (cons "EMACS_DIR_PATH" load-path))
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.acg" . acg-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'acg-mode "acg" "Major mode for editing ACG definitions" t)

where now EMACS_DIR_PATH is the acg directory in your site-lisp
directory (typically /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/acg)

************
* Examples *
************

Example files are given in the ./examples directory. Read the
./examples/README file

You can install this directory by running

      make install-examples

the examples directoryfile will be copied in the /DATAROOTDIR/acgtk
directory. The default value for /DATAROOTDIR is /PREFIX/share except
if you ran the ./configure script with some --datarootdir=/SOME/DIR
option.

If you installed acgtk using opam, then the default path is

	OPAM_REPOSITORY/OCAML_VERSION/share/acgtk

To uninstall the examples, run:

      make uninstall-examples




*********************
** For developpers **
*********************

You can get the documented API in all ./src subdirectories getting
there and running:

	make doc

It will create a doc subdirectory with htm files.
