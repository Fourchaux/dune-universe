(** This module implements a persistent array data structure as
    described in {{:
    http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ftp/publis/puf-wml07.ps}"A Persistent
    Union-Find Data Structure" (Sylvain Concohn and Jean-Chrisophe
    Filli√¢tre}.

    It is meant for managing quick access while keeping peristency in
    backtracking algorithms such as in unification algorithms using
    union find algorithms.

    In particular, when a persistent array [a_0] has been modified
    several times, yielding arrays [a_1], [a_2], ... , [a_N], when
    [a_i] is accessed using the [get] or [set] functions (with [0 <= i
    < N]) than all [a_j] with [i < j <= N] become unaccessible, hence
    a [Unacessible] exception is raised.

      [a_N], and that [a_i] is accessed using the [get] or [set]

  (** [init n f] returns a persistent array [a] of length [n] such

      [l] and containing its elements {e in the reverse order}*)

      {e starting at 1}.*)

      the same arrays remain accessible. *)
