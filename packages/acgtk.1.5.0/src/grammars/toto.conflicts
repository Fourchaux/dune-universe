** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 11.
** Token involved: IDENT
** This state is reached from heterogenous_term_and_type after reading:

IDENT 

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

heterogenous_term_and_type 
term COLON type_expression EOI 
not_atomic_term 
(?)

** In state 11, looking ahead at IDENT, reducing production
** atomic_type_or_term -> IDENT 
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

term0 nonempty_list(term0) // lookahead token appears because nonempty_list(term0) can begin with IDENT
atomic_type_or_term // lookahead token is inherited
IDENT . 

** In state 11, looking ahead at IDENT, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IDENT nonempty_list(IDENT) DOT term 
      . IDENT
