; -*-org-*-

* DONE Add an optional ";" before the "end" keyword
* DONE Change lexers to avoid problems with keywords
* DONE Add precedence values and management in the signature
* DONE Add (+) notation style to prevent the infix use of +
* DONE Add syntactic extensions to handle associativity and precedence of infix operators
* TODO Add error (and warning) messages management to the Error module, and make a difference between "real" parsing errors and errors resulting from evaluating the parsing against some environment. The latter can be output all together (may be some limit to be set)
* DONE Move from dypgen to menhir in scripts
* DONE change README and INSTALL files:
+ [X] to indicate new dependencies (menhir, logs...)
+ [X] to document syntax extensions for infix operators, precedence of the latter over application. Highest precedence for prefix operators
* DONE What about lexicon composition when one lexicon at least is non-linear?
* TODO Add debug flag (+ flag for log sources?)
* TODO Change command line parsing to use Cmd
