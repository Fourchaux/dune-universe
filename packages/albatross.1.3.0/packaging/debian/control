Description: Albatross - orchestrate and manage MirageOS unikernels with Solo5
  The goal of albatross is robust deployment of [MirageOS](https://mirage.io)
  unikernels using [Solo5](https://github.com/solo5/solo5). Resources managed
  by albatross are network interfaces of kind `tap`, which are connected to
  already existing bridges, block devices, memory, and CPU. Each unikernel is
  pinned (`cpuset` / `taskset`) to a specific core.
