;;; Commentary:

;; This simple package allows to call asak on the current buffer.

;; The variable asak_db must be set to a database made with "utils/build_assoc.ml"

;;; Code:

(defgroup anzad nil
  "Tools for running anzad."
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom asak_db ""
  "The path to the asak database."
  :type 'string
  :group 'anzad)

(setq prev_call ())

(defun anzad-clean-prev-call ()
  "Remove annotations from a previous call of anzad."
  (interactive)
  (dolist (elem prev_call)
    (let ((start (nth 0 elem))
	  (end   (nth 1 elem)))
      (remove-list-of-text-properties start end
				      (list 'font-lock-face 'cursor-sensor-functions))
      )
    )
  (setq prev_call ())
  (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
  )

(defun anzad ()
  "Call asak on the file of the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (cursor-sensor-mode 1)
  (anzad-clean-prev-call)
  (shell-command-to-string "dune build @check")
  (setq letbinds
	(butlast
	 (split-string
	  (shell-command-to-string
	   (format "anzad -m -d %s %s"
		   asak_db buffer-file-truename))
	  "#")))
  (dolist (letbind letbinds)
    (let* ((infos (split-string letbind ";"))
	   (start (1+ (string-to-number (nth 0 infos))))
	   (end   (1+ (string-to-number (nth 1 infos)))))
      (progn
       (put-text-property start end 'font-lock-face '(:foreground "red"))
       (put-text-property start end 'cursor-sensor-functions
			  (list (lambda (x y z)
				  (when (eq z 'entered) (message "%s" (nth 2 infos))))))
       (setq prev_call (cons (list start end) prev_call)))
      )
    )
  (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
