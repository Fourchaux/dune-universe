    (* Within each connected component, we can expect most nodes to
       have a distance to each other. We store nodes as dense arrays
       by indexing the input leaves from 0 to N-1, and we store
       distances between nodes in a dense matrix.

       At most N-1 non-leaf nodes will be created by the clustering process.
       (One way to prove this is to look at the number of nodes that are "roots"
       (do not have a parent) at any point in the construction. At the beginning,
       the N leaves are all roots. Each time we add a new node, its children were
       roots and are not anymore, so have one less root. At the end, there is at least
       one root.)
       So we index all intermediate trees in the construction from 0 to 2N-2, starting
       with the initial leaves, and filling the end of those arrays/matrices with nodes
       as they constructed.

       The fast algorithm keeps the following state:
       - [nodes]: a mapping from indices to trees
       - [roots]: a boolean array to know which trees are roots at the current step
       - [distances]: a matrix of distances between all known nodes
       - [next_slot]: the index of the next node to be constructed
       - [queue]: a priority queue of pairs of nodes,

       At a given step, only the indices from [0] to [!next_slot - 1] represent valid trees,
       so the values in [roots], [distances] and [nodes] above [!next_slot] are invalid.

       Because distances are symmetric, we store the distance between indices [i] and [j]
       in [distances.(min i j).(max i j)].
       (We could store only a diagonal matrix to save space.)
