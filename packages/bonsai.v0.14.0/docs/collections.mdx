The "Collection Combinators" in Bonsai are functions that take a Bonsai
component and then transform its [[model or input] and result] by some collection.

Right now, the only collection combinator that has been implemented is the one
for maps.

## <tt> Bonsai.Map </tt>

The Map combinators are some of the more interesting functions in Bonsai.  They
allow you to apply a Bonsai component to every key/value pair in a `Map.t` and
produce a new Map that contains the `'result`s of those components.

### <tt> Bonsai.Map.assoc\_input </tt>

Consider the following scenario: Your application has a `(k, v) Map.t` in
its input.  You also have a Bonsai component of type `(k * v, r) Bonsai.t`.
With `assoc_input`, it is possible to "map" your component over the Map in
the input and produce a new map from `k` to `r`.

This function could be useful if, for example, your Map is stored on
the server and sent to the application, which does not modify it.

```ocaml
# #show Bonsai.Map.assoc_input
val assoc_input :
  ('key, 'cmp) Bonsai_types.comparator ->
  ('data, 'result) Bonsai.t ->
  (('key, 'data, 'cmp) Base.Map.t, ('key, 'result, 'cmp) Base.Map.t) Bonsai.t
```

#### Example

```ocaml
# let int_to_string = Bonsai.pure ~f:string_of_int
val int_to_string : (int, string) Bonsai.t = <abstr>
# let ints_to_strings = Bonsai.Map.assoc_input (module Int) int_to_string
val ints_to_strings :
  ((int, int, Int.comparator_witness) Base.Map.t,
   (int, string, Int.comparator_witness) Base.Map.t)
  Bonsai.t = <abstr>
```

### <tt> Bonsai.Map.associ\_input </tt>

The same as `Bonsai.Map.assoc_input` but each component also receives
the corresponding map key as part of its input.

```ocaml
# #show Bonsai.Map.associ_input
val associ_input :
  ('key, 'cmp) Bonsai_types.comparator ->
  ('key * 'data, 'result) Bonsai.t ->
  (('key, 'data, 'cmp) Base.Map.t, ('key, 'result, 'cmp) Base.Map.t) Bonsai.t
```
