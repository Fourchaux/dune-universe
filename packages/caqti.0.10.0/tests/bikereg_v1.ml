(* This is an example of how to use Caqti directly in application code.
 * This way of defining typed wrappers around queries should also work for

(* Query Strings
 * =============
 *
 * Queries are normally registered in advance.  This allows Caqti to emit
 * prepared queries which are reused throughout the lifetime of the
 * connection.  The two most useful functions to do this are
 *
 *   - [prepare_sql] creates a query string which should work with all SQL
 *     databases of interest.
 *
 *   - [prepare_fun] creates a per-database query string.
 *
 * It's possible to avoid many dialect variation cases by using a function
 * which translates the placeholders for parameters, like [Q._q] defined in
 * [tests/test_sql_lwt.ml]. *)

  let create_bikereg = oneshot_sql
    "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bikereg_v1 (\
        frameno text NOT NULL, \
        owner text NOT NULL, \
        stolen timestamp\
     )"

  let reg_bike = prepare_sql_p
    "INSERT INTO bikereg_v1 (frameno, owner) VALUES (?, ?)"

  let report_stolen = prepare_sql_p

    "SELECT frameno, owner, stolen FROM bikereg_v1 WHERE stolen IS NOT NULL"

  let select_frameno = prepare_sql_p
    "SELECT * FROM bikereg_v1 WHERE frameno = ?"
end

(* Wrappers around the Generic Execution Functions
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Here we combine the above queries with a suitable execution function, for
 * convenience and to enforce type safety.  We could have defined these in a
 * functor on CONNECTION and used the resulting module in place of Db. *)

(* Db.exec runs a statement which must not return any rows.  Errors are
 * reported as exceptions. *)

  Db.exec Q.create_bikereg [||]

let report_stolen (module Db : Caqti1_lwt.CONNECTION) frameno =
  Db.exec Q.report_stolen Db.Param.([|string frameno|])

(* Db.find runs a query which must return at most one row.  The result is a
 * option, since it's common to seach for entries which don't exist. *)
let find_bike_owner frameno (module Db : Caqti1_lwt.CONNECTION) =
  Db.find_opt Q.select_frameno Db.Tuple.(string 1) Db.Param.([|string frameno|])

(* As a helper for iterators, [wrap db f] accepts a raw tuple and passes its
 * converted components as arguments to [f].  First-class modules are
 * brilliant, though they sometimes requires us to elaborate type
 * dependencies.  *)
let wrap (type tuple)
         (module Db : Caqti1_lwt.CONNECTION with type Tuple.t = tuple)
         f (t : tuple) =
  let open Db.Tuple in
  (* You might prefer to pass the result as a tuple or record depending on the
   * application. *)
  f ~frameno:(string 0 t) ~owner:(string 1 t) ?stolen:(option utc_cl 2 t) ()

(* Db.iter_s iterates sequentially over the set of result rows of a query. *)
let iter_s_stolen (module Db : Caqti1_lwt.CONNECTION) f =
  Db.iter_s Q.select_stolen (wrap (module Db) f) [||]

(* There is also a Db.iter_p for parallel processing, and Db.fold and
 * Db.fold_s for accumulating information from the result rows. *)
