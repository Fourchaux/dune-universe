module type PARAM = sig
  type t
  (** An abstract type for a query parameter.  Only the backend knows the
      actual type. *)

  val null : t
  (** A designated value to replace a missing parameter. For SQL, [null] is
      [NULL]. *)

  val option : ('a -> t) -> 'a option -> t
  (** [option f None] is [null] and [option f (Some x)] is [f x]. *)

  val bool : bool -> t
  (** Constructs a boolean parameter. If the database does not have booleans, an
      integer value of 0 for false and 1 for true is used. *)

  val int : int -> t
  (** Constructs an integer parameter. The remote end may have a different
      range. For SQL, works with all integer types. *)

  val int32 : int32 -> t
  (** Constructs an integer parameter. The remote end may have a different
      range. For SQL, works with all integer types. *)

  val int64 : int64 -> t
  (** Constructs an integer parameter. The remote end may have a different
      range. For SQL, works with all integer types. *)

  val float : float -> t
  (** Constructs a floating point parameter. Note that the precision in the
      database may be different from that of the OCaml [float]. If conversion to
      string is requried by the backend, this is done with the [%.*g] format
      specifier, which may incur a small loss of precision, as well. *)

  val string : string -> t
  (** Given an UTF-8 encoded text, constructs a textual parameter with
      backend-specific encoding. *)

  val bytes : bytes -> t
  (** Constructs a parameter from an arbirary octet string.  For SQL, the
      parameter is compatible with the [BINARY] type. *)

  val date_string : string -> t
  (** Construct a date paramater from a string using ISO 8601 format. *)

  val date_tuple : int * int * int -> t
  (** Construct a date parameter from the year, month, and day of the month,
      using the literal enumeration. I.e. Epoch is [(1970, 1, 1)]. *)

  val date_cl : CalendarLib.Date.t -> t
  (** Construct a parameter representing a date. *)

  val utc_float : float -> t
  (** Construct a parameter representing date and time in the UTC time zone,
      converted from a float representing the number of non-leap seconds passed
      since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. *)

  val utc_string : string -> t
  (** Create a parameter for an UTC timestamp field from a UTC time string in
      ISO 8601 format. *)

  val utc_cl : CalendarLib.Calendar.t -> t
  (** Construct a parameter representing an date and time in the UTC time
      zone. *)
end

(** Tuple decoding functions.

    These functions extracts and decodes components from a returned tuple.
    The first argument is the index, starting from 0.  The conversion
    performed are the inverse of the same named functions of {!PARAM}, so the
    documentation is not repeated here.

    {b Note!}  Calls to these functions are only valid during a callback
    from one of the query execution functions.  Returning a partial call or
    embedding the call in a returned monad leads to undefined behaviour. *)
