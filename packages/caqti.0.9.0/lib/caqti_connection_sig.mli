(** Signature of connection handles. *)

(** Essential connection signature implemented by drivers. *)

  (** [call ~f request params] performs [request] with parameters [params]
      invoking [f] to process the result. *)


  (** {2 Transactions} *)

  val start : unit -> (unit, [> Caqti_error.transact]) result future
  (** Starts a transaction if supported by the underlying database, otherwise
      does nothing. *)

  val commit : unit -> (unit, [> Caqti_error.transact]) result future
  (** Commits the current transaction if supported by the underlying database,
      otherwise does nothing. *)

  val rollback : unit -> (unit, [> Caqti_error.transact]) result future
  (** Rolls back a transaction if supported by the underlying database,
      otherwise does nothing. *)


  (** {2 Disconnection and Reuse} *)

  val disconnect : unit -> unit future
  (** Calling [disconnect ()] closes the connection to the database and frees
      up related resources. *)

  val validate : unit -> bool future
  (** For internal use by {!Caqti_pool}.  Tries to ensure the validity of the
      connection and must return [false] if unsuccessful. *)

  val check : (bool -> unit) -> unit
  (** For internal use by {!Caqti_pool}.  Called after a connection has been
      used.  [check f] must call [f ()] exactly once with an argument
      indicating whether to keep the connection in the pool or discard it. *)
