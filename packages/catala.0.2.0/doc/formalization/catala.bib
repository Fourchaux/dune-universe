abstract="In nonmonotonic reasoning conflicts among defaults are ubiquitous. For instance, more specific rules may be in conflict with more general ones, a problem which has been studied intensively in the context of inheritance networks (Poole, 1985; Touretzky, 1986; Touretzky et al., 1991). When defaults are used for representing design goals in configuration tasks conflicts naturally arise. The same is true in model based diagnosis where defaults are used to represent the assumption that components typically are ok. In legal reasoning conflicts among rules are very common (Prakken, 1993) and keep many lawyers busy (and rich).",
