# Building SerAPI Manually

SerAPI is available for different Coq versions, with each of its
branches targeting the corresponding Coq branch. The current
development branch is `v8.10` targeting Coq's `v8.10` branch.

Basic build instructions are below; the `.travis.yml` files should
contain up-to-date information in any case. We recommend using OPAM to
setup the build environment, however ThÃ©o Zimmermann has reported
success in [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

0. The currently supported OCaml version is 4.07.1:
   ``$ opam switch 4.07.1 && eval $(opam env)``. We also assume `COQVER=v8.10`.
1. Install the needed packages:
   `$ opam install cmdliner sexplib dune ppx_import ppx_deriving ppx_sexp_conv yojson ppx_deriving_yojson`.
2. Download and compile Coq. We recommend:
   `$ git clone -b ${COQVER} https://github.com/coq/coq.git ~/external/coq-${COQVER} && cd ~/external/coq-${COQVER} && ./configure -local -native-compiler no && make -j $NJOBS`.
3. Type `make SERAPI_COQ_HOME=~/external/coq-${COQVER}` to build `sertop`.

Alternatively, you can install Coq `>= 8.10` using OPAM and build against it using just `make`.

The above instructions assume that you use `~/external/coq-${COQVER}`
directory to place the Coq build that SerAPI needs; you can modify
the `SERAPI_COQ_HOME` variable in `Makefile` to make this change
permanent, or override the provided default.

SerAPI does use the [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) build system, thus standard Dune considerations do apply.

## Executing built binaries

A special consideration is that SerAPI does provide serialization
plugins that are loaded when Coq plugins are. In particular, SerAPI
does use `findlib` to manage plugins' dependencies, so you must
execute `sertop` and `sercomp` using `dune exec` or with the proper
`OCAMLPATH` pointing out to the right install location of Coq.

If that is not properly done, the usual symptom is the error message:
```
(CoqExn "Cannot link ml-object ground_plugin.cmxs to Coq code (Fl_package_base.No_such_package(\"coq-serapi.serlib.ground_plugin\", \"\"))."))
```
When executing binaries via `dune exec`, be sure to pass any arguments after `--`, e.g., `dune exec sercomp -- --help`.
## Advanced Developer Setup

SerAPI builds using Dune which supports modular builds. Starting with
Coq 8.10 you can indeed compose the build of Coq and SerAPI.

This is still experimental; we will provide more details soon.
