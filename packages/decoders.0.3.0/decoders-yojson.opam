synopsis: "Interface to yojson for decoders"
description: """
A combinator library for "decoding" JSON-like values into your own Ocaml types, inspired by Elm's `Json.Decode` and `Json.Encode`.

> Eh?

An Ocaml program having a JSON (or YAML) data source usually goes something like this:

1. Get your data from somewhere. Now you have a `string`.
2. *Parse* the `string` as JSON (or YAML). Now you have a `Yojson.Basic.json`, or maybe an `Ezjsonm.value`, or perhaps a `Ocyaml.yaml`.
3. *Decode* the JSON value to an Ocaml type that's actually useful for your program's domain.

This library helps with step 3.
