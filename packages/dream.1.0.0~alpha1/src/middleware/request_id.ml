(* TODO The other major built-in middleware, prefix, is actually just going to
   be built-in code. So it's probably best to look into building in request_id,
   and getting rid of the concept of built-in middleware. *)

(* TODO Restore the prefix, make the id random, or something else. *)
(* TODO Now that the request id is built in, there is no good way for the user
   to pass in a prefix... except perhaps through the app. However, this is
   probably worth it, because adding request_id to every single middleware
   stack is extremely annoying, given that you always want it and it's so cheap
   that there is no reason not to use it. It's probably very rare that someone
   needs a prefix. *)

     storage. *)

(* TODO LATER Maybe it's better to build the request id straight into the
   runtime? There's no real cost to it... is there? And when wouldn't the user
   want a request id? *)
(* TODO LATER List arguments for built-in middlewares: 0 or so cost, highly
   beneficial, in some cases (prefix) actually necessary for correct operation
   of a website. *)
