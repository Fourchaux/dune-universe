(* The path must:
   - Not have any .. or . components.
   - Not have any empty components. This should not be possible in Dream except
     for the last component, which, if empty, indicates a directory. We still
     check all components for robustness' sake.
   - Not be empty.
   - Not have the prefix /. Dream's path function generates a path with such a
     prefix, with the meaning that it is the site root. We remove that. The
     remaining path must not be an absolute path. *)
(* TODO On Windows, should we also check for \ and drive letters? *)
(* TODO Not an efficient implementation at the moment. *)
(* TODO It may be better to convert Dream's string list to a path first and then
   re-parse it, to avoid any potential issues with nested / due to any bugs that
   may be introduced. *)
