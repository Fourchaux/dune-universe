# Installing the Electrod compiler

Installation has been tested on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. It most probably does
not work on MS Windows.

## Installation through OPAM (recommended)

The easiest way to install Electrod is to rely on the OPAM OCaml package
manager.

Just type the following in a shell:
```
opam update
opam upgrade 
opam install electrod
```

After installation, you will see a program called "electrod" in your PATH.
