.SH NAME
.PP
ocaml\-gettext \- program to manage PO and MO files for OCaml source
files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ocaml\-gettext \-\-action verb options* [file...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the ocaml\-gettext command.
.TP
.B \-\-action extract
Files provided are considered to be OCaml source files and
ocaml\-gettext tries to extract translatable strings of it.
The output of the command is a POT file.
As a special case, if a file named POTFILES is in the list of the file
provided, every line of it is considered as a file to be searched.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-action compile
Files provided are considered to be PO file.
These files are compiled in binary MO files,
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-action install
Files provided are considered to be MO files.
They are installed in their respective directories considering language,
textdomain and category,
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-action uninstall
This is the symmetric command to install, but it uninstalls files
provided for the considered language, textdomain and category,
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-action merge
Merges a POT file with the provided PO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-extract\-command cmd
Command to extract translatable strings from an OCaml source file.
This command should output the same marshalled structure as
ocaml\-xgettext.
The best to do is to use the same build version of ocaml\-gettext.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-extract\-default\-option options
Default options used when extracting translatable strings.
These options are camlp4 options and will be passed to ocaml\-xgettext
when processing files that don\[aq]t already have specific camlp4
options.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-extract\-filename\-option filename options
Specific filename camlp4 options.
It is used when extracting strings from the specified filename.
It overrides default camlp4 options.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-extract\-pot filename
POT file to write when extracting translatable strings.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-compile\-output filename
MO file to write when compiling a PO file.
If not provided, the output will be the name of the PO file with ".mo"
extension.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-install\-language language
Language to use when installing a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-install\-category category
Category to use when installing a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-install\-textdomain textdomain
Textdomain to use when installing a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-install\-destdir dirname
Base directory to use when installing a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-uninstall\-language language
Language to use when uninstalling a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-uninstall\-category category
Category to use when uninstalling a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-uninstall\-textdomain textdomain
Textdomain to use when uninstalling a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-uninstall\-orgdir dirname
Base directory used when uninstalling a MO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-merge\-pot filename
POT file to use as a master for merging PO file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-merge\-backup\-extension extension
Backup extension to use when moving PO file which have been merged.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-version
Return version information on ocaml\-gettext.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-short\-version
Returns only the version of ocaml\-gettext.
The return is made to be easily parseable by configure script.
The output of this command will always be the shortest version string,
made of numeric characters (0\-9) and ".".
The version strings should be compared considering that a version A is
greater than a version B if there is a number between two "." of A that
is greater than B the corresponding number, beginning at the right of
the string.
For example: 0.14 is greater than 0.13.1.

.SH OCAML\-GETTEXT OPTIONS
.PP
This section describes briefly the common options provided by programs
using ocaml\-gettext library.
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe ignore
Defines the behaviour of ocaml\-gettext regarding any error that could
be encountered during the processing of string translation.
ignore is the default behaviour.
The string returned is the original string untranslated.
This behaviour is consistent and allows to have a usable output, even if
it is not perfect.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe inform\-stderr
Same behaviour as ignore, except that a message is printed on stderr,
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe raise\-exception
Stops the program by raising an exception when an error is encountered.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-disable
Disables any translation made by ocaml\-gettext.
All translations return the original string untranslated.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-domain\-dir textdomain dir
Defines a dir to search for a specific domain.
This could be useful if MO files are stored in a non standard directory.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-dir dir
Adds a directory to search for MO files.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-language language
Sets the language to use in ocaml\-gettext library.
The language should be POSIX compliant.
The language should follow the following convention:
lang[_territory][.charset][\@modifier].
The lang and territory should be two letters ISO code.
Charset should be a valid ISO character set (at least recognised by the
underlying charset recoding routine).
For example, valid languages are: fr_FR.ISO\-8859\-1\@euro,
de_DE.UTF\-8.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-codeset codeset
Sets the codeset for output.
.RS
.RE
.PP
Users should be aware that these command line options, apply only for
strings after the initialisation of the library.
This means that if the options initially guessed by ocaml\-gettext
don\[aq]t match the command line provided, there should be some
untranslated string, because these strings are translated before parsing
options.
This is particularly true for the usage message itself (\-\-help): even
if the strings are translated, they are translated before setting the
correct option.
.PP
Some options (\-\-gettext\-codeset for example) are overrided internally
for particular use.
It should be required to always translate strings to UTF\-8 in graphical
user interface (because GTK2 requires it).
.SH NOTES
.PP
Options \-\-uninstall\-language, \-\-uninstall\-textdomain,
\-\-install\-language and \-\-install\-textdomain could be guessed from
the filename provided.
You must be aware that these options can conflict with the fact that you
provide several files to install.
For example, if you provide a textdomain, you should either install
several MO files which filenames only reflect the language or only one
MO file if you also provide a language.
For example, you can execute ocaml\-gettext \-\-install\-textdomain
mytextdomain fr.po de.po without problem, but you cannot execute
ocaml\-gettext \-\-install\-textdomain mytextdomain
\-\-install\-language fr fr.po de.po .
This restriction is due to the fact that you should not over specified
file installation.
.PP
Rules for guessing the language/textdomain are:
language[.textdomain].mo.
For a full automated install without giving any hints, through command
line options, you should name your file fr.mytextdomain.mo or
de.mytextdomain.mo.
