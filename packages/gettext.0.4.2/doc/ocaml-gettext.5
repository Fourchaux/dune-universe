.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This section describes briefly the common options provided by programs
using ocaml\-gettext library.
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe ignore
Defines the behaviour of ocaml\-gettext regarding any error that could
be encountered during the processing of string translation.
ignore is the default behaviour.
The string returned is the original string untranslated.
This behaviour is consistent and allows to have a usable output, even if
it is not perfect.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe inform\-stderr
Same behaviour as ignore, except that a message is printed on stderr,
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-failsafe raise\-exception
Stops the program by raising an exception when an error is encountered.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-disable
Disables any translation made by ocaml\-gettext.
All translations return the original string untranslated.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-domain\-dir textdomain dir
Defines a dir to search for a specific domain.
This could be useful if MO files are stored in a non standard directory.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-dir dir
Adds a directory to search for MO files.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-language language
Sets the language to use in ocaml\-gettext library.
The language should be POSIX compliant.
The language should follow the following convention:
lang[_territory][.charset][\@modifier].
The lang and territory should be two letters ISO code.
Charset should be a valid ISO character set (at least recognised by the
underlying charset recoding routine).
For example, valid languages are: fr_FR.ISO\-8859\-1\@euro,
de_DE.UTF\-8.

.RE
.TP
.B \-\-gettext\-codeset codeset
Sets the codeset for output.
.RS
.RE
.PP
Users should be aware that these command line options, apply only for
strings after the initialisation of the library.
This means that if the options initially guessed by ocaml\-gettext
don\[aq]t match the command line provided, there should be some
untranslated string, because these strings are translated before parsing
options.
This is particularly true for the usage message itself (\-\-help): even
if the strings are translated, they are translated before setting the
correct option.
.PP
Some options (\-\-gettext\-codeset for example) are overrided internally
for particular use.
It should be required to always translate strings to UTF\-8 in graphical
user interface (because GTK2 requires it).
