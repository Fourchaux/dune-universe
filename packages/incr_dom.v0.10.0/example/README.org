This directory contains a few examples of how the =incr_dom= library
can be used.

To run any of these examples, follow the steps below:

- To compile to JavaScript, you first need to set the Omake build
  environment variable =WITH_JAVASCRIPT= to true.  In emacs, you can
  do this using the command =M-x Omake.setenv= (just follow the
  prompts), and you can check its current value in the Omake status
  buffer using the command =C-c C-v=.

- Once the variable is set, start compilation in the usual way (=C-c
  C-c= in emacs). Once this is done, there should be a .js file in
  =lib/incr_dom/example/EXAMPLE=, where =EXAMPLE= is the directory for
  the specific example.

- Next, you need to start an HTTP server so that you can access the
  example from a different machine.  Navigate to the root of the
  feature where you compiled the example, and run the following
  command:

  #+begin_src
  # python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  #+end_src

- Finally, open a web browser (this can be on a machine that is not
  your workstation).  Go to the following URL, where =WORKSTATION= is
  your workstation's name, and =EXAMPLE= is the directory for the
  specific example.

   http://WORKSTATION:8080/lib/incr_dom/example/EXAMPLE/index.html

You should now be able to see and interact with the example
application!
