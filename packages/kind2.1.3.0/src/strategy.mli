(** A strategy returns an [Analysis.param option] which is [None] if done.
    It takes
    - the results so far, and
    - a list of scope / [bool] pairs with the scopes sorted in topological
      order, starting from the top-most one. Booleans indicate whether the
      corresponding system can be abstracted. *)

(** Information used by the strategy module. *)
type info = {
  can_refine: bool ;   (** Is the system refineable? ([extern] for lustre nodes.) *)
  has_contract: bool ; (** Does the system have a contract? *)
  has_modes: bool ;    (** Does the system have modes? *)
}

(** Takes some results and some information about (sub)systems, and returns
the next analysis to perform, if any.
The information it takes is

- a function which, given the scope of a system, returns the scope of its
  direct subsystems and its strategy info;
- a list of all the scopes of all the systems and their strategy info. *)

whether the subsystem is candidate for analysis
*)

(** Works almost the same as [next_analysis], but returns a single analysis
parameter for a monolithic analysis. Only used for contract generation. *)
