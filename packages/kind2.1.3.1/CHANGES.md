# Kind 2 v1.3.1

This release includes performance improvements and various fixes. Notably:

- Fix soundness issue in path compression when there are temporal dependencies
  between input values. (Thank you to M. Anthony Aiello for finding this bug).
- Fix bug in extraction of an active path during IC3 generalization.
- Improve IC3 performance over large models that contain reals or machine integers.
- Fix issue reading models from the latest version of Z3 (4.8.10).
  It caused a runtime error during IVC generation.


# Kind 2 v1.3.0

New features:

- Computation of [Inductive Validity Cores](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/10_inductive_validity_core.html) and [Minimal Cut Sets](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/11_minimal_cut_set.html).
- Invariant generation for machine integers (engine names: INVGENMACH and INVGENMACHOS).
- IC3 model checking engine for machine integers.
  - The pre-image computation is based on quantifier elimination over bit-vectors.
  - It requires SMT solver Z3 at this time.
- Support for abstract types ([#594](https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/pull/594), thanks to Amos Robinson).
- Support for SMT solvers Boolector and MathSAT.
  - It requires the develop version of Boolector at this time (commit 5d18baa and later).
- New command-line option to only parse Lustre inputs (`--only_parse true`).

Improvements:

- Support for version 1.8 of SMT solver CVC4.
- Improved support for [machine integers](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/3_machine_ints.html).
- Reduced number of activation literals used in BMC encoding.
- Fixed returned exit code for modular analysis ([#684](https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/pull/684)).
- Other bug fixes.

Changes:

- Removed CZMQ sources and OCaml bindings for CZMQ from the Kind 2 repository.
  - Kind 2 now requires [ZMQ](https://zeromq.org/) 4.x or later to be installed on your system.
- Replaced old build system with new one based on [dune](https://dune.build/) and [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/).
  - See [README](README.rst) file for new requirements and installation instructions.


# Kind 2 v1.2.0

New features:

- Support for [machine integers](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/3_machine_ints.html).
- Option to output results in [JSON format](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/3_output/2_machine_readable.html).
- [Interpreter](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/8_interpreter.html) accepts input values in JSON format.

Many bug fixes!


# Kind 2 v1.1.0

This new version features many internal improvements as well as several new
features over v1.0.1 (more than 300 commits):

- Support for Scade 6 automata (see [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/1_lustre.html#hierarchical-automata))
- Support for Scade 6 arrays
- Arithmetic invariant generation: up to v1.0.1, the main invariant generation
  technique besides the IC3 engine was boolean template-based invariant
  generation. This technique can discover equalities and implications between
  predicates over the state variables of the system.

  The technique has been extended to arithmetic terms (`int` and `real`): Kind
  2 can discover equalities and orderings (`<=`) between arithmetic terms mined
  from the input system.

  The boolean, integer and real template-based invariant generation techniques
  all come in two flavors: one-state which can only relate terms over the
  current state, and two-state which can relate terms mentioning the current
  and the previous state.

  Each of them runs as a different process at runtime. By default, only the
  following are active:

  - INVGENOS (one-state boolean)
  - INVGEN (two-state boolean)
  - INVGENINTOS (one-state integer)
  - INVGENREALOS (one-state real)
- Several features distinct from the actual verification process were
  introduced in Kind 2 v1.0.0: certification, contract generation, compilation
  to Rust, and test generation.

  These features are now aggregated under the term [*post-analyses*](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/1_post_analyses.html).
  Most of them have been improved and v1.1.0 introduces a post-analysis:
  [invariant logging](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/7_invariant_logging.html). This feature attempts to log
  strengthening invariants discovered by Kind 2 as a contract.
- *Silent contract loading* attempts to load contracts generated by Kind 2
  during previous runs as candidate properties for the current run (see
  [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/1_post_analyses.html#silent-contract-loading))


# Kind 2 v1.0.1

- Read files on standard input in Lustre format


# Kind 2 v1.0.0

This new version brings many new features and improvements over v0.8 (more
than 800 commits).

NB:

- Kind 2 now requires OCaml 4.03 or higher

New features:

- 2-induction: makes Kind 2 react quicker to *good strengthening invariants*
  discovered by invariant generation
- Assume/guarantee-based contract language with modes as Lustre annotations (see [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/1_lustre.html#contracts))
    - specification-checking: before checking a node with a contract, check
      that the modes from the contract cover all situations allowed by the
      assumptions (implementation-agnostic mode exhaustiveness)
- Compositional reasoning: `--compositional` (see [contract semantics](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/2_contract_semantics.html))
    - abstraction of subnodes by their contract
- Modular analyses: `--modular`
    - Kind 2 traverses the node hierarchy bottom-up
    - applying the analysis specified by the other flags to each node
    - reusing results (invariants) from previous analyses when relevant
    - allows refinement when used with compositional reasoning
- Compilation from Lustre to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): `--compile`
- Mode-based test generation: `--testgen`
    - explores the DAG of activeable modes from the initial state up to a depth
    - generates witnesses as traces of inputs logged as XML files
    - compiles the contract as an executable oracle in
      [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): reads a sequence of inputs/outputs
      values for the original node on `stdin` and prints on `stdout` the
      boolean values the different parts of the contract evaluate to
- Generation of certificates and proofs: `--proof` and `--certif`
    - produces either SMTLIB-2 certificates or LFSC proofs
    - distributed with LFSC proof rules for k-induction
    - requires CVC4, JKind and the LFSC checker for proofs
    - generate proofs skeletons for potential holes
- Support for forward references on nodes, types, constants and contracts
- Output and parser for native (internal) transition system format
- Contract generation: `--contract_gen`
  - Very experimental: the modes generated might not be exhaustive and the
    check exhaustiveness check might fail
  - This feature's main goal, for now, is to help users get started with
    contracts by generating a contract stub partially filled with invariants
    discovered by invariant generation

Improvements:

- Flags are now organized into modules, see `--help` and `--help_of <module>`
- Mode information (when available) to counterexample output
- Optimized invariant generation
- Named properties and guarantees
- Colored output
- No more dependencies on Camlp4
- Strict mode to disallow unguarded pre and undefined local variables
- Many bug fixes and performance improvements
- Added mode information (when available) to counterexample output
- Rewrote invariant generation from scratch: much faster now
- czmq fixes: there should be no process still running after Kind 2 exits
