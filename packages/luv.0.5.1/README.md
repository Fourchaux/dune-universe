[**Luv**][luv] is an OCaml/ReasonML binding to [libuv][libuv], the
cross-platform C library that does asynchronous I/O in Node.js and runs Node's
main loop.

Here's an example, which retrieves the Google search page:

```ocaml
let () =
  Luv.DNS.getaddrinfo ~family:`INET ~node:"google.com" ~service:"80" ()
      begin fun result ->

    let address = (List.hd (Result.get_ok result)).addr in
    let socket = Luv.TCP.init () |> Result.get_ok in
    Luv.TCP.connect socket address begin fun _ ->

      Luv.Stream.write socket [Luv.Buffer.from_string "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"]
        (fun _ _ -> Luv.Stream.shutdown socket ignore);

      Luv.Stream.read_start socket (function
        | Error `EOF -> Luv.Handle.close socket ignore
        | Error _ -> exit 2
        | Ok response -> print_string (Luv.Buffer.to_string response))

    end
  end;

  Luv.Loop.run () |> ignore
```

<br/>

libuv does more than just asynchronous I/O. It also supports
[multiprocessing][processes] and [multithreading][threads]. You can even [run
multiple async I/O loops, in different threads][loops]. libuv wraps a lot of
other functionality, and exposes a [comprehensive operating system API][api].

Indeed, Luv does not depend on [`Unix`][unix]. It is an alternative operating
system API. Nonetheless, Luv and `Unix` can coexist readily in one program.

Because libuv is a major component of Node.js, it is
[cross-platform][platforms] and [well-maintained][maintainers]. Luv, being a
fairly thin binding, inherits these properties.

<br/>

Luv takes care of the tricky parts of dealing with libuv from OCaml:

- **Memory management** &mdash; Luv keeps track of OCaml objects that have been
  passed to libuv, and are otherwise referenced only by C callbacks.
- **The OCaml runtime lock** &mdash; multithreaded Luv programs are safe.
- **API problems** &mdash; where libuv is forced to offer difficult APIs due to
  the limitations of C, Luv provides more natural APIs.
- **The build** &mdash; when Luv is installed, it builds libuv, so users don't
  have to figure out how to do it.

Basically, when wrapped in Luv, libuv looks like any normal OCaml library, with
the kind of usage functional programmers expect.

<br/>

One of the design goals of Luv is to be easy to integrate into larger libraries,
such as [Lwt][lwt]. To that end, Luv is...

- **Minimalist** &mdash; Luv only takes care of inherent libuv headaches, such
  as memory management, building as little else as possible over libuv.
- **Unopinionated** &mdash; Luv avoids committing to design decisions beyond
  those dictated by libuv and OCaml.
- **Maintainable** &mdash; Luv uses [Ctypes][ctypes] to minimize the amount of C
  code in this repo, and [vendors][vendor] libuv to avoid versioning issues.

Luv is [thoroughly tested][tests]. Apart from checking return values and I/O
effects, the test cases also check for memory leaks, invalid references, and
potential issues with multithreading.

## Installing

```
opam install luv
```

If using esy, add

```
"dependencies": {
  "@opam/luv": "*"
}
```

<br/>

## Documentation

- [User guide][guide]
- [API reference][api]
- [Examples][examples] &mdash; explained in the [user guide][guide].
- [libuv manual][libuv-docs]

<br/>

## Experimenting

You can run any example by cloning the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/aantron/luv.git --recursive
cd luv
opam install --deps-only .
```

*Note: the clone *has* to be recursive, because libuv is vendored using a git
module.*

Then, to run, say, [`delay.ml`][delay.ml]...

```
dune exec example/delay.exe
```

The first time you do this, it will take a couple minutes, because Luv will
build libuv.

You can add your own experiments to the [`example/`][examples] directory. To run
them, add the module name to [`example/dune`][example/dune], and then run them
like any other example:

```
dune exec example/my_test.exe
```

Alternatively, you can try Luv in a REPL by installing [utop][utop]:

```
opam install --unset-root utop
dune utop
```

Once you get the REPL prompt, try running `Luv.Env.environ ();;`

<br/>

## Future

- [ ] A "post-compose" functor that applies a transformation to the whole API,
for globally converting callbacks to promises, changing the error handling
strategy, etc. Prototype was [here][postcompose].
- [ ] Integration with [Lwt][lwt]. There was an old [example][lwt-integration]
that used the early post-compose functor and a [Luv-based Lwt event
loop][lwt-loop].
- [ ] Luv could make multithreaded event-driven programming very easy by lazily
initializing a loop for each thread, and storing the reference to it in a TLS
key that Luv uses internally. This could be especially powerful once OCaml has a
genuine multicore runtime.
- [ ] [`let*` operators][let] for convenient chaining of callbacks.

## License

Luv has several pieces, with slightly different permissive licenses:

- Luv itself is under the [MIT license][license].
- This repo links to libuv with a git submodule. However, a release archive will
  generally include the full libuv source. Portions of libuv are variously
  [licensed][libuv-license] under the MIT, 2-clause BSD, 3-clause BSD, and ISC
  licenses.
- The user guide is a very heavily reworked version of [uvbook][uvbook],
  originally by Nikhil Marathe, which was incorporated into the libuv docs as
  the [libuv user guide][libuv-guide], and made available under
  [CC BY 4.0][guide-license].
