v0.2.0 - 06/07/21
-----------------

* This should be considered the first official release.

* Adapt to OCaml 4.12, drop support for 4.11 beta.

* Fix races and remove experimental warning: it now works under both
  native and bytecode, and the internal state is protected against
  asychronous exceptions arising from memprof callbacks (especially
  memprof-limits' own interrupt). Other asynchronous exceptions (e.g.
  Sys.Break arising from a signal handler) should still be considered
  fatal.

* Add token limits: interrupts that can be triggered at a distance.

* Switch license to `LGPL-3.0-linking-exception`.

* Full documentation generated by `odoc`.

* Breaking changes in names and signatures in the API, aiming towards
  stabilization.

* Allocation limits: express limit in thousands of words, for better
  portability. In case of success, the estimated allocation count is
  returned along with the result.

* Updated documentation to mention the compatibility with Lwt detached
  threads.

* Avoid pitfalls of `module type of` regarding forward-compatibility.

* Do not export private modules.
