   than the previous number. *)

(* Whereas the function [next] on the candidate side has type ['a t -> int], the
   function [next] on the reference side has type ['a t -> int postcondition].
   Its arguments are the generator [g] and the result produced by the function
   [next] in the candidate implementation. It returns a value of type [int
   diagnostic] that indicates whether the candidate result is valid or invalid.
   In the latter case, the diagnostic includes an OCaml assertion that allows
   reproducing the problem. *)
