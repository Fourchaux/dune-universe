(* A concrete type: [exn]. *)

(* [exn] is used in the definition of the combinator [(^!>)]. *)

(* We view [exn] as a deconstructible type only, because exceptions
   are always a result that is observed, never an argument. *)

(* We equip the type [exn] with an extensible notion of equality. Initially,
   it is the default equality; this implies that when the candidate and
   reference implementations both raise an exception, they are expected to
   raise exactly the same exception. The user can override this with new
   cases. *)
