(** [custom f] describes a term whose application to a list of actual
    arguments [actuals] is printed as dictated by the document [f actuals].
    This allows performing certain simplifications on the fly; e.g., an
    identity function might decide to print the application [id e] as just
    [e]. Be careful, though. *)
val custom: (document list -> document) -> appearance

(* Accessors. *)

(** [value] is the first projection. *)
val value: 'a code -> 'a

(** [print code actuals] constructs a document which represents an application
    of the value [code] to the actual arguments [actuals]. *)
val print: 'a code -> document list -> document

(** [apply appearance actuals] is short for [print (_, appearance) actuals]. *)
val apply: appearance -> document list -> document

(** [string code] is a string which represents the value [code], applied to
    zero arguments. *)
val string: 'a code -> string
