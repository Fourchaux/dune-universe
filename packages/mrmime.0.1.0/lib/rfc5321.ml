   Sometimes a host is not known to the domain name system and
   communication (and, in particular, communication to report and repair
   the error) is blocked.  To bypass this barrier, a special literal
   form of the address is allowed as an alternative to a domain name.
   For IPv4 addresses, this form uses four small decimal integers
   separated by dots and enclosed by brackets such as [123.255.37.2],
   which indicates an (IPv4) Internet Address in sequence-of-octets
   form.  For IPv6 and other forms of addressing that might eventually
   be standardized, the form consists of a standardized "tag" that
   identifies the address syntax, a colon, and the address itself, in a
   format specified as part of the relevant standards (i.e., RFC 4291
   [8] for IPv6).

   Specifically:
