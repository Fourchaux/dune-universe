## ocaml-topexpect -- expect tests that mimic the OCaml toplevel

A variant of ocaml-expect from `toplevel_expect_test` that mimics ocaml
toplevel more closely.

This is still a work-in-progress library that is initially being used in the
new iteration of Real World OCaml, and so is not yet publishing a stable API.
If you wish to use it in other tools, please contact the authors.
