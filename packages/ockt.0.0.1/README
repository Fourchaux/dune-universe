this is a little ocaml library for ckt
takes ckt source string and spits out a hashtable

some notes:
this code is not made to be performant, in fact, in may be really unperformant!

this is just because it was more fun to code this way, however unperformant it may be

this is also because it was a little easier for me to treat strings as char lists, 
which comes with a lot of memory & performance overheads.

for this i don't think it really matters, but if you're really looking for performance,
oops!

i also dont know if this is the 'ocaml way' of doing things or w/e, coming from other
languages such as haskell i treated it like i was programming in those languages!
