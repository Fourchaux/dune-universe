Skeleton generator for OCaml projects

oskel is a tool for generating stubs of OCaml projects pre-equipped with the
standard boilerplate: OCamlformat config file, Alcotest scaffolding,
auto-generation of [*.opam] files via [dune-project] etc. It supports generating
binaries with Cmdliner, Fmt and Logs support. The resulting projects are
compliant with [dune-release lint].
