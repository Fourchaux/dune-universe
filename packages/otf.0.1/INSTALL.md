To compile and install otf locally, you need the OCaml compiler and
the dune build system. You can get the sources from GitLab
(https://gitlab.com/pictyeye/otf). From the main directory, you just
have to type

    % make
    % make check
    % make install

The package should also be installable via opam

    % opam install otf
