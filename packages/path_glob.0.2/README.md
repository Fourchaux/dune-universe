# Path_glob: checking glob patterns on paths.

`Path_glob` is a small library to match strings (in particular
filesystem paths) against glob-style patterns, or boolean combinations
of patterns.

See the [module
documentation](https://gasche.gitlab.io/path_glob/path_glob/index.html),
including a short example.

For another library achieving similar purposes, see the
[Re.Glob](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-re/blob/master/lib/glob.mli)
module of [ocaml-re](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-re).
