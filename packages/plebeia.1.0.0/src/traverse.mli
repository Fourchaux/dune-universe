   Suppose we have 2 root hashes, rh1, rh2, where rh2 is a decendant of rh1.
   Let top1 and top2 are the top nodes of rh1 and rh2 respectively.

   A node n which is reachable from top2 is:
   
   * If the index of n is newer than the index of top1, n is unreachable
     from top1.
   
   * If the index of n is older than the index of top1, 
                                                        
       * If n is a small leaf which is cached, n may be unreachable from top1.
       * Otherwise, n is always reachable from top1.

   Using the above property, we can reduce the memory usage.
