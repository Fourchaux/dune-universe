# TODO

* How to handle query params?
* Provide sibling libraries providing closer integration with frameworks like:
    * incr_dom
    * httpaf
    * ocaml-vdom

* ~~Explore using a non-copying view into a string. Something similar to `Substring` module provided in `Core_kernel`. Bigstringaf maybe?~~
