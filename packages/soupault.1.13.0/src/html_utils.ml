(** Parse HTML in specific context.

  HTML parser behaviour depends on context. For example, when the result is supposed to be
  a complete document, it must insert <head> or <body> elements if they are missing.
  If the result is supposed to be a fragment, it must not do that.

  lambdasoup doesn't provide a context-aware parsing function, so we turn to lower level
  Markup.ml for that.
