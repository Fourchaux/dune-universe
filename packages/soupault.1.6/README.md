soupault
========

Soupault is a static website generator based on HTML rewriting rather than template
processing. It is based on the [lambdasoup](http://aantron.github.io/lambdasoup/) library and named after
the French dadaist and surrealist poet Philippe Soupault.

In a startup pitch style, it's a website generator for Markdown haters.
