<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I have graduated from the Miskatonic Institute of Technology where I majored in computer science
and minored in applied mythology. My thesis was &ldquo;Zipf's law and the Necronomicon&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
I'm now working on obscenity-tolerant data transmission protocols at the Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company.
