(* "Spell checking" for config options based on "normalized" identifiers.

    In code/configs, letter typos (e.g. "Strign.lowrrcase_asci") is just one
    class of errors. Misplaced or wrong delimiters are just as common,
    and so in incorrect capitalization.

    To get a reasonable chance to guess what the user meant, we strip identifiers
    down to their "essence" by removing all delimieters and using case-insensitive
    string comparison.
