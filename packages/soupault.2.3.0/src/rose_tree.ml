(* Extracts a top level section from a flat list of headings.

   Since there can be any number of <h1> elements,
   we have two possible options: consider all headings children of a virtual root,
   or treat it as multiple independent trees.

   The latter approach allows for simpler types, since adding a virtual root
   would require node data to be 'a option _just_ to accomodate the root,
   while all real headings are guaranteed to have non-empty data.

(* Multi-way tree with artificial node identifiers.

   Heading text is not guaranteed to be unique, headings are not guaranteed
   to have unique id attributes either.
   How do we make sure we can insert a node in the headings tree at a well-defined position?
   The number of each heading in the document is unique, so we use it as a node identifier.

   Having unique identifiers means we can insert at a "path" in the tree,
   where a path is a sequence of node identifiers.
   E.g. "first h2 after the first h1" would be [1; 2].

   When the tree is ready, those identifiers are useless, so we'll remove them later.
