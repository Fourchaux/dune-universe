(** Removes index page's parent dir from its navigation path

    When clean URLs are used, the "navigation path" as in the path
    before the page doesn'a match the "real" path for index pages,
    and if you try to use it for breadcrumbs for example,
    section index pages will have links to themselves,
    since the parent of foo/bar/index.html is technically "bar".
    The only way to deal with it I could find is to remove the
    last parent if the page is an index page.

    The reason for this extension juggling is that people may use page preprocessors

    In short, that's what Jekyll et al. always did to non-blog pages.
