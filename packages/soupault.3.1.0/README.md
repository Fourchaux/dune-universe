Soupault is an HTML manipulation tool. It can be any of:

* static site generator
* HTML processor
* metadata extractor

or all of them at the same time.

Soupault works with the HTML element tree of the page, so it can do many thing that traditionally could be done with client-side JS:
inject new HTML into existing complete pages, create a table of contents that preserves the `id` elements of HTML headings and more.

It also doesn't use front matter and extracts metadata from HTML instead, using a CSS3 selector to metadata field mapping,
so even hand-written static pages can be indexed rather than treated as assets. For example:

```toml
[index.fields.title]
  # Try to find <h1 id="post-title"> if it exists,
  # else use the first <h1> 
  selector = ["h1#post-title", "h1"]

[index.fields.excerpt]
  selector = ["p#post-excerpt", "p"]

[index.fields.date]
  selector = ["time#post-date", "time"]
  extract_attribute = "datetime"
  fallback_to_content = true
```

Extracted metadata can then be rendered and injected into pages:

```toml
[index.views.blog]
  # Insert rendered data into the element that matches "#blog-index" CSS selector.
  index_selector = "#blog-index"
  index_item_template = """
    <h2><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Last update:</strong> {{date}}.</p>
    <p>{{excerpt}}</p>
    <a href="{{url}}">Read more</a>
  """
```

Soupault is...

* Eternal: it comes as a statically-linked binary with no dependencies.
* Extensible: you can bring your own [page preprocessors](https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#page-preprocessors) (e.g. Markdown to HTML convertors), pipe HTML elements through [external programs](https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#preprocess-element-widget), and load [Lua plugins](https://soupault.app/plugins/).
* Flexible: most options are configurable and most built-in features can be reimplemented as Lua plugins.

Soupault is named after the French dadaist and surrealist writer Philippe Soupault
because it's based on the [lambdasoup](http://aantron.github.io/lambdasoup/) library.
