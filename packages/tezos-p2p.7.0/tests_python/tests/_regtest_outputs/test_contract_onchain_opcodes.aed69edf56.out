Estimated gas: 33330 units (will add 100 for safety)
Estimated storage: 257 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
Operation successfully injected in the node.
Operation hash is '[BLOCK_HASH]'
NOT waiting for the operation to be included.
Use command
  tezos-client wait for [BLOCK_HASH] to be included --confirmations 30 --branch [BLOCK_HASH]
and/or an external block explorer to make sure that it has been included.
