open Store

(* This module offers an implementation of [STORE] based on a simple form
   of mutable transactional references. *)

include STORE

(* [tentatively s f] runs the function [f] within a new transaction on the
   store [s]. If [f] raises an exception, then the transaction is aborted,
   and any updates performed by [f] are rolled back. Otherwise, the updates
   performed by [f] are committed. *)

(* Two transactions on a single store cannot be nested. *)

(* A cell that is created during a transaction still exists after the
   transaction, even if the transaction is rolled back. In that case,
   its content should be considered undefined. *)
